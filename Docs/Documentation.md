Presentation
=============

A simple music player based on Python, Qt, GStreamer and TagLib. Functionalities include :
- Customizable library tree view
- Customizale playlist view
- Gapeless playback
- Library search
- Global shortcuts
- Remote control
- Web radio
- 10 band equalizer
- Tagging facilities

All kinds of audio files are supported, provided that you installed the related gst-plugin (might already be installed on your computer). The GUI is freely - and mostly - inspired by foobar2000 default interface.

Installation
=============
Install the dependencies: pyTagLib, pyQt4, gst-python 1.0. Copy the repository in a folder. Create a named-pipe called pipe in that folder by running `mkfifo pipe`. Run with Python3 ! (and hope everything is OK)

If you are running a 64bit linux distribution and do not want to install all the dependencies, you can download the archive, extract it, create the pipe in the folder and run `./Foo.cd`


Default behaviour
=============
Press the *Alt* key to show or hide the main window menu.

Library
- *Enter*: append songs to playlist and play
- *Shift+Enter*: append songs to playlist
- *Right click*: context menu for tagging and ReplayGain

Playlist
- *Enter*: play
- *Del*: delete song from playlist


Shortcuts
=============

Shortcuts concist of a combination of *modifier+key* to trigger an action. They can all be customized in the config file. Modifier takes value among: `Ctrl, Shift, Alt, Meta` (windows key).

Keys are named: `A, B, F1, F2, Left, Right, Tab, Del, Ins, PgUp, Plus, Minus, ...`. Modifiers and keys can be combined using `+`, e.g. `A+B, Ctrl+Shift, ... `

Thus for a configuration file as:
```
...
modifier = Ctrl
play_pause = Shift+Space
stop = A
...
```
Pressing `Ctrl+Shift+Space` will *pause* the playback, `Ctrl+A` will *stop* the playback.

Shortcut actions:
- play/pause
- stop
- next
- previous
- quit
- volume up
- volume down
- toggle radio mode
- open equalizer


Tree order and Playlist columns functions
==========================================

The hierarchy of the tree library and the playlist columns can be customized in the configuration file, following a basic syntax.

`tree_order = %albumartist% (%genre%)| [%date%] - %album% | $Disc %discnumber% | $ %tracknumber%. %title%`

where:

- Tags are surrounded by *%*, they include any field present in your files plus the defaults: `%length%, %samplerate%, %channels%, %bitrate%`
- Optional parts can be specified using `$...$`. This will display the formated tags for the tracks having the requested fields and nothing for the others.
	For example `$Disc %discnumber%$` will display *Disc 1* for files having a %discnumber% tag, and nothing for the others
- The pipe `|` separator is used as sub-level for the tree and new column for the playlist


Special tags :
- `%file%` : path of the file
- `%albumartist%` : if the tag exist in the file it contains the value otherwise it si mapped to the artist tag. Useful for compilation type CDs.
- `%trackartist%` : contains the artist tag only for albums having an albumartist tag different from artist tag


The tree order shown above will give the following tree :

```
		Buena Vista Social Club (Cubano)
			|-- [1996] - Buena Vista Social Club
					|-- 1. Chan Chan
					|-- 2. De Camino A La Vereda
					|-- ...
		George Duke (Jazz)
			|-- [1974] - Feel
			|-- [1975] - The Aura Will Prevail
			|-- [2006] - The Essential
					|-- Disc 1
						|-- 1. Scuse me miss
						|-- 2. Reach for it
						|-- ...
					|-- Disc 2
			|-- [2008] - Dukey Treats
		...
```

Album art
=========
Currently, pytaglib does not support reading and writting of images in music tags. Foo.cd looks for album art in the folder containing the files. File names and extensions can be specified in the configuration file, as a list of values separated by a pipe character `|`.


Equalizer
=========
The equalizer is opened using a shortcut (specified in the configuration file).
New preset can be added, they will copy the values from the current preset.
After modifying the equalization, click the save button to register changes.
Presets can be deleted first by selecting them from the dropdown list and then clicking on the remove button.


Tagging
=======
You can inspect and modify tags of your files by right-clicking on any node of the tree and selecting *Tagging*.
All the children of that node will be selected.
- Columns can be renamed by double clicking on their title (values will be kept but tag name will be changed)
- Tags can be edited by double clicking in any cell
- Multiple selection can be deleted by pressing the delete key

**Note** : For any cell left empty or containing only whitespaces the corresponding tag will be removed from the files (or not created if a column is added and only some of its cells are filled).


ReplayGain
==========
TODO
Config replay_gain_album_mode


Radio
=====
It is possible to switch between *radio* and *library* mode using a shortcut (specified in the configuration file).
The `stations` field in the configuration file is the list of web radios separated by a pipe character `|`. Each radio is a tuple: the name given to the radio and its url, separated by `!`

When in radio mode, Foo.cd will retrieve available tags from the stream and display them. The `prefered_information` field in the configuration file allow to specify which tags should be displayed. It is important to remember that the availability of tags depends on the stream.

Remote interface
=============
Foo.cd can be controlled by writing keywords to the pipe, allowing global shortcuts (e.g. using xmonad), ssh control, etc.

Keywords:
- play_pause
- stop
- volume_up
- volume_down
- song_next
- song_prev
- tree_up
- tree_down
- tree_left
- tree_right
- tree_validate
- tree_append
- radio_mode
- quit

The actions related to keywords should be self explanatory.
In radio mode  `tree_up` and `tree_down` actually control the selection in the radio list up and down,
`song_next` and `song_prev` directly change the radio station being listened,
`tree_left, tree_right` and `tree_append` are deactivated,
and the others function just like in library mode.
